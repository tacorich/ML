There are many methods for upsampling, and one common method is bilinear interpolation. Simply speaking, in order to get the pixel of the output image at the coordinates $(x, y)$, the coordinates are first mapped to the coordinates of the input image $(x', y')$. This can be done based on the ratio of the size of three input to the size of the output. The mapped values $x'$ and $y'$ are usually real numbers. Then, we find the four pixels closest to the coordinate $(x', y')$ on the input image. Finally, the pixels of the output image at coordinates $(x, y)$ are calculated based on these four pixels on the input image and their relative distances to $(x', y')$. Upsampling by bilinear interpolation can be implemented by transposed convolution layer of the convolution kernel constructed using the following `bilinear_kernel` function. Due to space limitations, we only give the implementation of the `bilinear_kernel` function and will not discuss the principles of the algorithm.\n"

Because the model uses a transposed convolution layer with a stride of 32, when the height or width of the input image is not divisible by 32, the height or width of the transposed convolution layer output deviates from the size of the input image. In order to solve this problem, we can crop multiple rectangular areas in the image with heights and widths as integer multiples of 32, and then perform forward computation on the pixels in these areas. When combined, these areas must completely cover the input image. When a pixel is covered by multiple areas, the average of the transposed convolution layer output in the forward computation of the different areas can be used as an input for the softmax operation to predict the category.\n",
